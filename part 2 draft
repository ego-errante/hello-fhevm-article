Of course. Based on my critique, here is a new draft outline for the smart contract section of your article. This structure follows a narrative, code-first approach that walks the developer through the contract's lifecycle, explaining the "why" behind each FHEVM concept.

### Part 2: The Confidential Smart Contract (`RockPaperScissors.sol`)

**Objective:** To write and understand a complete, confidential Rock-Paper-Scissors smart contract. We'll go beyond just looking at snippets and build a solid mental model of how FHEVM works in practice.

**1. The Full Picture: Our `RockPaperScissors.sol` Contract**

- Start by presenting the **entire** `RockPaperScissors.sol` contract in a single code block.
- **Narrative Hook:** "Before we dissect it, let's look at the finished product. This is a fully functional, confidential smart contract. In the following sections, we'll break it down piece-by-piece, following the lifecycle of a game from creation to resolution."

**2. Defining the Game: State Variables and Encrypted Types**

- **Code Focus:** Show the `GameStatus` enum and the `Game` struct.

  ```solidity
  enum GameStatus { Created, Player1MoveSubmitted, Resolved }

  struct Game {
      address player1;
      address player2;
      euint8 move1;
      euint8 move2;
      euint8 result;
      GameStatus status;
  }
  ```

- **Key Concept: Encrypted Types (`euint8`)**
  - Introduce `euint8` as the cornerstone of FHEVM. Explain it's an **encrypted unsigned 8-bit integer**.
  - **The "Why":** Clarify that any variable of this type (`move1`, `move2`, `result`) holds ciphertext. Its value is unreadable on-chain, even to the contract itself. Contrast this with a standard `uint8`, which would expose the moves to the public.

**3. Let the Games Begin: `createGame()`**

- **Code Focus:** Show the `createGame()` function.
- **Explanation:** Walk through its simple logic: initializing a game, setting `player1`, and setting the `Created` status. This is standard Solidity and serves as a familiar entry point before we dive into the FHE-specific functions.

**4. Making a Confidential Move: `submitEncryptedMove()`**

- **Code Focus:** Show the complete `submitEncryptedMove()` function.
- **Explanation - The "FHE Magic" Begins:**
  - **Parameters:**
    - `encryptedMove`: This isn't a number like 0, 1, or 2. It's an encrypted value passed from the frontend.
    - `inputProof`: Explain that FHEVM requires a proof to prevent users from submitting maliciously crafted ciphertexts. Mention that the `fhevm-react` library conveniently generates this for us on the client side.
  - **Key Concept: On-Chain, Confidential Input Validation**
    - **Code Focus:** `euint8 validatedMove = FHE.rem(encryptedMove, 3);`
    - **The "Why":** This is a critical FHE operation. The contract is ensuring the submitted move is valid (0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors) _without ever decrypting it_. This is impossible in a standard contract and is a perfect, simple example of the power of confidential computing.
  - **Logic Flow:** Briefly explain how the function handles the first and second moves, culminating in the call to `_resolveGame()`.

**5. The "Blind" Referee: `_resolveGame()`**

- **Code Focus:** Show the complete `_resolveGame()` private function.
- **Key Concept: Confidential Computation**
  - **Emphasize:** This entire function is the core of our dApp's privacy. It operates _exclusively_ on encrypted data. The contract is a "blind" referee that determines the winner without ever knowing the players' moves.
  - **Walkthrough of FHE Operations:**
    - `FHE.eq(game.move1, game.move2)`: Checking for a draw by comparing two ciphertexts for equality.
    - `FHE.and(...)`, `FHE.or(...)`: Building the winning logic (e.g., Rock beats Scissors) using boolean operations on encrypted values.
    - `FHE.select(isDraw, ...)`: A confidential ternary operator. It selects the outcome (0 for Draw, 1 for P1 win, 2 for P2 win) based on the encrypted boolean conditions.
  - **The "Why":** This section demonstrates that complex, state-changing logic can be executed on-chain while maintaining end-to-end encryption.

**6. Unlocking the Secret: `FHE.allow()` and Permissioned Decryption**

- **Code Focus:**
  ```solidity
  // Grant players access to decrypt ONLY the result
  FHE.allow(game.result, game.player1);
  FHE.allow(game.result, game.player2);
  ```
- **Key Concept: Granting Decryption Permissions**
  - **The "Why":** The game is over, but the result is still an encrypted secret. The `FHE.allow()` function is the final, crucial step. It doesn't decrypt the value; it creates a permission slip on-chain that authorizes a specific address to decrypt a specific piece of data.
  - **Highlight the Asymmetry:** Emphasize that we are only granting permission for `game.result`. We are **not** calling `FHE.allow` on `game.move1` or `game.move2`. This ensures that even after the game, Player 1 cannot see Player 2's move, and vice-versa, preserving the privacy of the inputs.

**7. Retrieving the Encrypted Result: The View Function**

- **Code Focus:** Show the public mapping `games` or a specific getter function that returns a `Game` struct.
- **The Missing Link:** Explain that to get the result, the frontend needs a way to read it from the contract.
- **Bridge to the Frontend Section:** "This getter function returns the full `Game` state, including the _encrypted_ result. The frontend will call this function, see the ciphertext, and then use the FHEVM client library to decrypt it. We'll cover exactly how that works in Part 3, when we build our React frontend."
