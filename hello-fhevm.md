## Conclusion

At this point, you have set up an environment for developing fullstack FHEVM dApps, written and deployed a confidential smart contract, and built a custom frontend to interact with it using client-side encryption/decryption.

Congratulations on building your first FHEVM dApp! Trying extending this with new features like betting, adding time limits, or writing your own FHEVM-powered dApp.
