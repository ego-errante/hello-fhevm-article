Excellent. Here is an improved draft outline for Part 3, incorporating the feedback and a more robust narrative structure. This version is designed to be a practical, code-anchored guide that walks the reader through the template's frontend architecture.

### Part 3: Building the Frontend (React + `@fhevm/react`)

_Our confidential smart contract is now on the blockchain, acting as a blind referee. But how do players interact with it? In this section, we'll build the client-side application that makes the magic of FHEVM tangible for the user. We'll use the `@fhevm/react` library, a powerful toolkit that simplifies all the complex cryptography into a few simple React hooks._

_**A Quick Note on Architecture:** The template's frontend is built with modularity in mind, using a series of custom hooks (`useFhevm`, `useGameActions`, etc.) that work together. While this is great for production code, our focus will be on the **specific FHEVM function calls** within these hooks. We'll follow the user's journey through the dApp to see how it all connects._

**1. The User Connects: Initializing the FHEVM Instance**

- **The First Step:** The journey begins when a user connects their wallet. This is our cue to prepare the client-side FHEVM environment.
- **Code Focus: `useFhevm.tsx`**
- **Key Concept: Creating the Bridge to FHEVM.**
  - Explain that the `useFhevm` hook is the foundation of our client-side logic. Its main job is to create and manage the **FHEVM instance**.
  - This instance is our primary interface for all cryptographic operations. It connects the user's wallet (for signing), the FHEVM network (to fetch the global public key), and our application logic.
  - Show the key code block from `useFhevm.tsx` where `createInstance` is called, explaining that this one-time setup is all we need to get started.

**2. The User Submits a Move: Encryption → On-Chain Computation**

- **User Action:** "A player selects 'Rock' and clicks the 'Submit Move' button."
- **Code Focus: `hooks/useRockPaperScissors/useGameActions.ts`**
- **Key Concept: Client-Side Encryption.**
  - **Step 1: Encrypting the Move.** Before the move is sent to the blockchain, we must encrypt it. This critical step happens entirely within the user's browser, ensuring the plaintext value (e.g., `0` for Rock) is never exposed.
    - Dive into the `submitMoveMutation` function within `useGameActions.ts`.
    - Highlight the line: `const encryptedMove = instance.encrypt_uint8(move);`
    - Explain that this function takes a simple number and transforms it into a ciphertext that is safe to broadcast.
  - **Step 2: Sending to the Contract.** With the move now encrypted, we call the `submitEncryptedMove` function on our smart contract.
    - Show the `writeContract` call that passes the `encryptedMove`.
    - **Connect the Dots:** Remind the reader that this is the same function we built in Part 2, and the contract will now confidentially validate this move and store it.

**3. The User Views the Result: Authorization → Decryption**

- **User Action:** "Both players have submitted their moves. The game is resolved. Now, a player clicks 'View Results' to see who won."
- **Code Focus: `hooks/useRockPaperScissors/useGameResults.ts`**
- **The "Aha!" Moment:** The game's result is on-chain, but it's still encrypted. Simply reading from the contract only returns the ciphertext. To reveal the outcome, we must perform a crucial two-step process.

- **Key Concept 1: Authorization via Signature.**
  - **The "Why":** The FHEVM instance is powerful, but for security, it cannot decrypt data unilaterally. It needs explicit permission from the user for each piece of data. We get this by asking the user to sign a message with their wallet.
  - Show the key line from the `fetchGameResults` function: `const signature = await instance.getSignature(...)`.
  - Explain this concept: The signature acts as a temporary, single-use "permission slip." It proves the user's identity and authorizes the FHEVM instance to decrypt a _specific_ ciphertext from a _specific_ contract.

- **Key Concept 2: Decryption.**
  - **The Payoff:** Once we have the signature, we can finally decrypt the result.
  - Show the next line in the code: `const decryptedResult = instance.decrypt(game.result, signature);`.
  - Emphasize that this function will **only succeed** for `player1` and `player2`. Why? Because our smart contract granted them permission with `FHE.allow()` back in Part 2. If anyone else tried this flow, the decryption would fail. This completes the end-to-end, permissioned, confidential workflow.

**4. Tying It All Together: The Main Component and Orchestrator Hook**

- **Code Focus: `components/RockPaperScissorsDemo.tsx` and `hooks/useRockPaperScissors/useRockPaperScissors.tsx`**
- **The Big Picture:** Briefly explain how these final pieces fit.
  - `useRockPaperScissors.tsx` acts as the central controller, bringing together the state, actions, and results hooks.
  - `RockPaperScissorsDemo.tsx` is the UI layer. It calls the functions from the `useRockPaperScissors` hook to handle button clicks and displays the game's status and final, decrypted result.
- **Conclusion:** This brief overview shows how the individual cryptographic steps are integrated into a cohesive and user-friendly React application.
